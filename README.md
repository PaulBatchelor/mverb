mverb
=====

This is a fork. Eventually, I will rewrite this code into C99 C and get it
formatted to be a Soundpipe module.

In the meantime, the code development will remain here.

Studio quality, open-source reverb. Its release was intended to provide a 
practical demonstration of Dattorro's figure-of-eight reverb structure and 
provide the open source community with a high quality reverb.

All code is self-contained within the mverb.h file and an example showing 
inclusion in a VST plugin is included.
